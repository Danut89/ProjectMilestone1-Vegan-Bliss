## Testing

### Performance and Accessibility Testing

To ensure the website provides an optimal user experience, I conducted thorough testing using Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools. The tests focused on performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

#### Desktop Performance and Accessibility Test

![Desktop Lighthouse Test 1](./assets/readme-screenshoots/accesibility-desktop.png)

- **Performance**: Achieved a score of 99. Improvements were made by optimizing images, adding width and height attributes, and minifying CSS and JavaScript files.
- **Accessibility**: Scored 96, with enhancements such as adding aria-labels to links and buttons to improve screen reader compatibility.
- **Best Practices**: Scored 100, ensuring the site follows web standards and best practices.
- **SEO**: Scored 91, indicating good search engine optimization but with room for further improvements.

#### Mobile Performance and Accessibility Test

![Desktop Lighthouse Test 2](./assets/readme-screenshoots/Desktop%20lighthouse%20test.png)

- **Performance**: Initial test scored 84. Improvements were needed in reducing the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and optimizing images.
- **Accessibility**: Scored 96, similar to the desktop version.
- **Best Practices**: Scored 100, maintaining web standards.
- **SEO**: Scored 91, consistent with the desktop version.

![Mobile Lighthouse Test 1](./assets/readme-screenshoots/Mobile%20lighthouse%20test1.png)

- **Performance**: Subsequent optimizations improved the score to 91. This was achieved by further reducing image sizes, enabling text compression, and eliminating render-blocking resources.

![Mobile Lighthouse Test 3](./assets/readme-screenshoots/mobile-test2.png)
g
- **Performance**: Final optimizations resulted in a score of 99. This was done by ensuring all images are properly sized, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, and leveraging browser caching.


### Ongoing Testing
Continuous testing and user feedback are being gathered to improve and update the website regularly.

## Bugs

### Hamburger Menu Not Closing
- **Issue**: The hamburger menu was not closing when clicked on mobile devices.
- **Fix**: Added `data-bs-toggle` and `data-bs-target` attributes correctly to the button element. Updated the Bootstrap classes and ensured that the navigation structure matches Bootstrap's recommended structure for a collapsible navbar.
  - **Fix**: Updated the Bootstrap classes and JavaScript code to ensure proper functionality.

### Logo Text Visibility on Small Devices
- **Issue**: The logo text was cluttering the navbar on small devices.
- **Fix**: Implemented a utility class to hide the logo text on small devices and display it only on larger devices.

### 405 Error on Contact Form Submission
- **Issue:** When attempting to submit the contact form, users encountered a 405 error indicating that the request method was not allowed. This was due to the form attempting to send data to a server endpoint that does not exist for this static website.
- **Fix:** To resolve this issue, the form's `action` attribute was set to `"#"` and the `method` attribute was set to `"get"`. This ensures that the form submission does not attempt to post data to a server, thereby preventing the 405 error. The form now reloads the page upon submission without any errors.

### 405 Error on Subscribe Button
- **Issue:** Similar to the contact form, the subscribe button in the footer was also encountering a 405 error upon submission. This was because the form was attempting to send data to a non-existent server endpoint.

- **Fix:** The same method used to fix the contact form issue was applied here. The form's `action` attribute was set to `"#"` and the `method` attribute was set to `"get"`. This change prevents the form from attempting to post data and reloads the page upon submission without any errors.



### Accessibility Improvements
- **Issue**: Several accessibility issues were identified, including insufficient color contrast and links without discernible names.
- **Fix**: Improved color contrast by updating the CSS. Added `aria-label` attributes to links to provide better context for screen readers.

### Performance Improvements
- **Issue**: The website had a low performance score on mobile devices.
- **Fix**: Converted images to WebP format and added `width` and `height` attributes to images. Deferred loading of non-critical CSS and JavaScript. This resulted in significant improvement in performance scores.

### HTML Validation Errors
- **Issue**: Various HTML validation errors were found, such as stray start tags.
- **Fix**: Cleaned up the HTML by ensuring proper nesting and closing of tags. Validated the HTML using W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure compliance with web standards.

### CSS Validation Errors
- **Issue**: CSS validation errors were present.
- **Fix**: Cleaned up the CSS by removing unused styles and validating with W3C CSS Validation Service. Ensured that all styles are correctly formatted and adhere to CSS standards.

These fixes have improved the overall functionality, accessibility, and performance of the website.


### Known:
- **Map Alignment**: On medium-sized devices, the Google Map on the contact page does not center perfectly over the contact details. This requires further adjustment in CSS.
