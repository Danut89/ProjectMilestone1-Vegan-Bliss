## Bugs

### Hamburger Menu Not Closing
- **Issue**: The hamburger menu was not closing when clicked on mobile devices.
- **Fix**: Added `data-bs-toggle` and `data-bs-target` attributes correctly to the button element. Updated the Bootstrap classes and ensured that the navigation structure matches Bootstrap's recommended structure for a collapsible navbar.

### Logo Text Visibility on Small Devices
- **Issue**: The logo text was cluttering the navbar on small devices.
- **Fix**: Implemented a utility class to hide the logo text on small devices and display it only on larger devices.

### 405 Error on Contact Form Submission
- **Issue:** When attempting to submit the contact form, users encountered a 405 error indicating that the request method was not allowed. This was due to the form attempting to send data to a server endpoint that does not exist for this static website.
- **Fix:** To resolve this issue, the form's `action` attribute was set to `"#"` and the `method` attribute was set to `"get"`. This ensures that the form submission does not attempt to post data to a server, thereby preventing the 405 error. The form now reloads the page upon submission without any errors.

### 405 Error on Subscribe Button
- **Issue:** Similar to the contact form, the subscribe button in the footer was also encountering a 405 error upon submission. This was because the form was attempting to send data to a non-existent server endpoint.
- **Fix:** The same method used to fix the contact form issue was applied here. The form's `action` attribute was set to `"#"` and the `method` attribute was set to `"get"`. This change prevents the form from attempting to post data and reloads the page upon submission without any errors.

```html
<!-- Original Form -->
<form action="submit_form.php" method="POST">
    <!-- Form fields -->
</form>

<!-- Updated Form -->
<form action="#" method="get">
    <!-- Form fields -->
</form>
```

### Accessibility Improvements
- **Issue**: Several accessibility issues were identified, including insufficient color contrast and links without discernible names.
- **Fix**: Improved color contrast by updating the CSS. Added `aria-label` attributes to links to provide better context for screen readers.

### Performance Improvements
- **Issue**: The website had a low performance score on mobile devices.
- **Fix**: Converted images to WebP format and added `width` and `height` attributes to images. Deferred loading of non-critical CSS and JavaScript. This resulted in significant improvement in performance scores.

### HTML Validation Errors
- **Issue**: Various HTML validation errors were found, such as stray start tags.
- **Fix**: Cleaned up the HTML by ensuring proper nesting and closing of tags. Validated the HTML using W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure compliance with web standards.

### CSS Validation Errors
- **Issue**: CSS validation errors were present.
- **Fix**: Cleaned up the CSS by removing unused styles and validating with W3C CSS Validation Service. Ensured that all styles are correctly formatted and adhere to CSS standards.

### Navbar Button Alignment
- **Issue:** The "Login" button was not aligned with the navigation links.
- **Fix:** Added CSS to align the button vertically with the navbar links.

```css
.navbar-nav {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}

.login-button {
    margin-left: 10px;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100%;
}
```

### Fixed Bugs for Mobile Version

### Navbar
- **Issue**: Ensured the sticky navbar works seamlessly on mobile devices for better navigation.
- **Fix**: Adjusted the CSS for the sticky navbar to ensure it functions correctly across all devices.

### Footer
- **Issue**: Footer layout was not consistent in mobile version to ensure social media icons align properly and do not overlap.
- **Fix**: Added CSS flexbox properties to ensure proper alignment of the social media icons in the footer on all screen sizes.

```css
.social-network {
    text-align: center;
    display: flex; 
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 10px 0;
}

.social-network li {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

.social-network i {
    font-size: 150%;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

### Mailing List Subscription Box on Mobile
- **Issue**: The mailing list subscription box did not have sufficient padding on mobile screens, making it look cramped and less readable.
- **Fix**: Added responsive padding to improve visual appeal and readability.
 
### Images and Text
- **Images**: Properly sized images to reduce load time and improve overall performance on mobile devices.
- **Text Compression**: Enabled text compression for faster content delivery.

### Font Display Issues on Mobile
- **Issue**: The Roboto font was not displaying correctly on mobile devices.
- **Fix**: Ensure the font is properly imported and loaded across all devices.

### Tablet View Layout Issue for featuredrecipies Section
- **Issue**: On tablet view, the columns in the featuredrecipies section did not display correctly, showing 3 columns instead of 2.
- **Fix**: Utilized Bootstrap classes to adjust the column layout for medium-sized screens.

### Tablet View Layout Issue for Lifestyle Section
- **Issue**: On tablet view, the columns in the lifestyle section did not display correctly, showing 3 columns instead of 2.
- **Fix**: Utilized Bootstrap classes to adjust the column layout for medium-sized screens.

(SEE SCREENSHOOTS):

[Tablet view after fix](./assets/readme-screenshoots/tabletview-fixedlifestyle.png)

```<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">```

These fixes have improved the overall functionality, accessibility, and performance of the website.

### Known:

- **Map Alignment**: On medium-sized devices, the Google Map on the contact page does not center perfectly over the contact details. This requires further adjustment in CSS.
