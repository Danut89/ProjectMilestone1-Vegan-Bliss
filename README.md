g
- **Performance**: Final optimizations resulted in a score of 99. This was done by ensuring all images are properly sized, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, and leveraging browser caching.

### Specific Improvements Made

1. **Image Optimization**:
    - Converted images to WebP format for better compression and faster loading times.
    - Added width and height attributes to all images to avoid layout shifts.

2. **Aria-labels**:
    - Added aria-labels to all interactive elements such as links and buttons to improve accessibility for screen reader users.

3. **Minifying CSS and JavaScript**:
    - Minified all CSS and JavaScript files to reduce file sizes and improve load times.

4. **Leveraging Browser Caching**:
    - Implemented browser caching for static assets to reduce server load and improve repeat visit performance.

5. **Eliminating Render-Blocking Resources**:
    - Deferred non-critical JavaScript to ensure faster initial page load.

6. **Text Compression**:
    - Enabled text compression to reduce the amount of data transferred over the network.

These steps significantly enhanced both the performance and accessibility of the website, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience across all devices.
